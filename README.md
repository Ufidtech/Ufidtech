## Hello there, I am Ibrahim Danjuma! 👋

A computer science student focused on building strong software engineering fundamentals, 
With a growing interest in backend systems, cloud deployment, and AI-integrated applications.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student who enjoys turning ideas into functional, accessible, 
and reliable web applications. I currently work mainly with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, 
and I’m expanding into React, backend development with Node.js, and cloud technologies.

I care deeply about clean code, accessibility, and building solutions that solve real problems.
I also enjoy learning in public and contributing to communities through mentorship and collaboration.
